# Platform ideas and status

- PlayStation 2
  - ps2sdk has no (useful) documentation. There is a booting build of the game but it's not working, because of misconfigured IOP modules. üòû
<br/>
<br/>
- PlayStation
  - Not sure.
<br/>
<br/>
- N64
  - Not sure. Last time I checked their homebrew stuff it was pretty unappealing to me.
<br/>
<br/>
- SNES
  - No plans. Also it seems there is no C compiler. Only ASM. I prefer Sega ‚ù§ btw.
<br/>
<br/>
- Sega Mega Drive / Genesis
  - There are no tools to convert the colour palette of the sprites and the documentation is outdated. Tricky situation. üò¨
<br/>
<br/>
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) (SDL2)
  - Well, it's a mess. The build crashes right away. I tried so much, but can't get it working.
<br/>
<br/>
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - This will take sometime. I want it to become nice, but there is a prototype project.
<br/>
<br/>
- PS3
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. Homebrew on RPCS3 is not good yet (It's slow and unstable).
<br/>
<br/>
- Original Xbox
  - Is CXBX-Reloaded capable to run homebrew flawlessly?! Homebrew games were much too slow last time I tested it.
<br/>
<br/>
- Xbox 360
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. (XNA is dead on Xbox 360 üò¢). Can Xenia run homebrew well?! Never tested it.
<br/>
<br/>
- Java
  - Besides the libGDX version there is also an unfinshed LWJGL3 version. I'm not sure if I should finish it. Because it would be similar to the GLFW3 version in C, but in Java classes.
<br/>
<br/>
- PS Vita
  - I don't own one and not sure if Vita3k is "good" enough.
<br/>
<br/>
- HTML5
  - Sure, when I'm in the mood.

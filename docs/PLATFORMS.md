# Platform ideas and status

- PlayStation 2
  - ps2sdk has no (useful) documentation. There is a booting build of the game but it's not working and I actually don't know why. Just black screen. IOP modules load correctly, but something is wrong here üòû
    <br/>
- PlayStation
  - Not sure. No plans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- N64
  - Not sure. Last time I checked their homebrew stuff it was pretty unappealing to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- SNES
  - No plans. Also it seems there is no C compiler. Only ASM. I prefer Sega ‚ù§ btw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Sega Mega Drive / Genesis
  - There are no tools to convert the colour palette of the sprites and the documentation is outdated. Tricky situation. üò¨
    <br/>
    <br/>
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) (SDL2)
  - Well, it's a mess. The build crashes right away. I tried so much, but can't get it working.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - This will take sometime. I want it to become nice, but there is a prototype project.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- PS3
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. Homebrew on RPCS3 is not good yet (It's slow and unstable).
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Original Xbox
  - Is CXBX-Reloaded capable to run homebrew flawlessly?! Homebrew games were much too slow last time I tested it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Xbox 360
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. (XNA is dead on Xbox 360 üò¢). Can Xenia run homebrew well?! Never tested it. Also the homebrew situation is kind of meh over there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Java
  - Besides the libGDX version there is also an unfinshed LWJGL3 version. I'm not sure if I should finish it. Because it would be similar to the GLFW3 version in C, but in Java classes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- PS Vita
  - I don't own one and not sure if Vita3k is "good" enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- HTML5
  - Sure, when I'm in the mood.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- GameCube
  - Same situation as Wii. Audio would be a mess (Both use the same SDK). Also I don't know if SDL is there and actually I don't want to rework it for GX.

# Platform ideas and status

- PlayStation 2
  - ps2sdk has no (useful) documentation. There is a booting build of the game but it's not working and I actually don't know why. Just black screen. IOP modules load correctly, but something is wrong here 😞
    <br/>
- PlayStation
  - Not sure. No plans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- N64
  - Not sure. No plans. Last time I checked their homebrew stuff it was pretty unappealing to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- SNES
  - No plans. Also it seems there is no C compiler. Only ASM. I prefer Sega ❤ btw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Sega Mega Drive / Genesis
  - There are no tools to convert the colour palette of the sprites and the documentation is outdated. Tricky situation. 😬 There is a prototype build.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) (SDL2)
  - Well, it's a mess. The build crashes right away. I tried so much, but can't get it working. 😥😥😥
    <br/>
    <br/>
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - This will take sometime. I want it to become nice, but there is a prototype build.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- PS3
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. Homebrew on RPCS3 is not good yet (It's slow and unstable).
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Original Xbox
  - I don't own one. Is CXBX-Reloaded capable to run homebrew flawlessly?! Homebrew games were much too slow last time I tested it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Xbox 360
  - Waiting until it's safe to install CFW without the worry about a ban. (XNA is dead on Xbox 360 😢😥😥). Can Xenia run homebrew well?! Never tested it. Also the homebrew situation is kind of meh over there and there is the XNA version ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Java
  - Besides the libGDX version there is also an unfinshed LWJGL3 version. I'm not sure if I should finish it. Because it would be similar to the GLFW3 version in C, but in Java classes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- PS Vita
  - I don't own one and not sure if Vita3k is "good" enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- HTML5
  - ~~Sure, when I'm in the mood.~~<br/>
  Done using Phaser 3 on 22/04/2019 &#x2611;
    <br/>
    <br/>
- GameCube
  - Same situation as Wii. Audio would be a mess (Both use the same SDK). Also I don't know if SDL is there and actually I don't want to rework it for GX.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- MS-DOS
  - I'm planning to rework the DOS version at some point in the future as it is unstable/broken.

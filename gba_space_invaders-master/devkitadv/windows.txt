Dev-Kit Advance
by Jason Wilkins <fenix at io dot com>

Here is some preliminary stuff to get you started.  This file should
contain much more info in the future.

If you are using the windows command prompt (DOS or CMD), this works
best if you unzip all the packages into the root directory of the
drive and leave the name of the install directory as devkitadv.

If you are using the cygwin shell, unzip the packages into the root
of your cygwin directory.  Again, leave the name of the install 
directory as devkitadv.

To use from the command prompt, put c:\devkitadv\bin into your path 
like this

PATH=c:\devkitadv\bin;%PATH%

If you are using cygwin then you do it like this:

PATH=/devkitadv/bin:$PATH

If you are bone headed and decide that you want to install into a different
directory, then you will have to define the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX environment
variable to point to that install directory.

GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=c:/devkitadv/lib/gcc-lib/

Where c:/devkitadv/ is the installation directory.

Use forward slashes.  The trailing slash is required.

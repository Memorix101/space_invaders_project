# xbox-space-invaders

Space Invaders written in C++ for OG Xbox using [nxdk](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk)

### Current issue
- SDL_Mixer not implemented -> No sound, maybe use XAudio instead
- Collision hitbox issues -> maybe bullet without print or collision size is incorrect for bullet and/or player

## Note: This is experimental and broken !!!
